Main theme idea: 
- Game Title “idlefrog”
- The game is in a pond or river
- The currency gathered is flies 
- The number of frogs is based on the number of Lilly pads 
- Manual and automatic fly production logic? 
- Seasonal, player needs enough flies to feed the frogs over the winter
- “Substitute food” generation 
- Will there be other kinds of frogs? 

Gameplay loop?

- Currency is also Food

- Alternative Food



Kittens like seasonal mechanic? 

Kittens inspired ideas:
- seasonal 
- Keep the frogs alive 
- Currency is also food?
- 

End goal? 

Currency production? 
Main currency - flies 

Multiple currencies / resources? 


Multiple food types?

If multiple food types what is the diminishing currency that’s also food? 

Is flies the main food and the others are food but also used in other resources crafting?
